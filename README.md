## PartialHearts
Did you know you can have less than half a heart? Yeah, me neither. But it turns out, Minecraft actually tracks health with more precision than the half-heart increments we see on the display.

PartialHearts shows you the exact health value. It works with resource packs and the Colorful Hearts mod as well. Most vanilla damage sources still remove hearts in half-heart increments, but itâ€™s still fun to see your precise health when it does count. Plus a 1/34 heart challenge sounds much more extreme than half, doesn't it?
### Highly customizable

You can create fun patterns etched into your hearts as they lose health. With the built-in menu you can tweak the pixel removal settings to your heart's content (pun intended).
